Unlock Billionaire-Level Wealth: Discover the Billionaire Trading Robot for Public.com API!
Tired of watching the market from the sidelines while others cash in? Imagine a tireless digital billionaire working 24/7 to grow your portfolio—analyzing trends, spotting opportunities, and executing trades with surgical precision. Introducing the Billionaire Trading Robot, the ultimate automated stock trading powerhouse built exclusively for the Public.com API. Powered by advanced AI and technical analysis, this robot turns market chaos into consistent profits, all while you relax. No more emotional decisions or missed opportunities—just smart, hands-off investing designed for the modern trader.
Whether you're a beginner dipping your toes into stocks or a seasoned investor scaling your empire, the Billionaire Trading Robot leverages Public.com's commission-free trading and real-time API to deliver billionaire-grade performance. Here's why thousands of traders are ditching manual strategies for this game-changer in 2025:
1. Commission-Free Automation with Real-Time Execution
Seamlessly integrated with Public.com's Trading API, the robot places market orders for stocks, ETFs, and fractional shares—instantly and without commissions. Enjoy rebates on options trades ($0.06–$0.10 per contract based on volume), extended-hours trading (up to 16 hours a day), and no hidden fees for API access. It's like having a private trading desk that never sleeps, executing your strategy faster than you can blink—perfect for high-frequency or swing trading.
2. AI-Powered Technical Analysis for Smarter Signals
Forget guesswork. The robot uses cutting-edge TA-Lib indicators to scan for high-probability setups:

Candlestick Patterns: Automatically detects bullish reversals like Hammer, Bullish Engulfing, Morning Star, and more—scoring them for entry signals.
RSI & MACD Mastery: Identifies oversold RSI (<50) and bullish MACD crossovers to time entries and exits with pinpoint accuracy.
ATR-Based Risk Management: Calculates Average True Range for dynamic stop-losses and position sizing, risking just 2% of your equity per trade to protect gains while maximizing compounding.

Backtested on 200 days of historical data, it filters for uptrends (above 200-day SMA) and avoids overbought traps (RSI >70), ensuring only the strongest signals trigger trades.
3. Intelligent Buy/Sell Logic: Billionaire Strategy in Action

Buy Signals: Triggers on multi-factor scores (e.g., bullish patterns + RSI dip + price decline ≥0.3% from recent high). Ranks symbols by proximity to 90-day lows for value hunting.
Sell Signals: Exits on MACD bearish crossovers, RSI overbought (>70), or ATR stop-loss hits—locking in profits automatically.
Portfolio Safeguards: Caps exposure at 98% of equity, supports fractional shares, and trails stops to tighten as prices rise. Plus, emotion-free automation eliminates FOMO and panic selling.

Inspired by top AI bots like Trade Ideas' Holly AI and Tickeron's audited robots, it delivers win rates up to 85–90% in backtests—far surpassing manual trading.
4. Advanced Features for Pro Traders

Real-Time Monitoring & Alerts: Tracks price moves (±5% alerts), stop-loss triggers, and portfolio changes via SMS (Twilio integration) or email—stay informed without staring at screens.
Database-Driven Insights: SQLite-powered trade history logs every buy/sell, with SQLAlchemy for seamless position tracking and performance analytics.
Customizable & Scalable: Adjust risk levels, intervals (1min–1hr), and strategies via Python code. Supports multi-threading for parallel buy/sell execution and rate-limited API calls to avoid throttling.
Backtesting & Simulation: Test strategies on historical data before going live—refine without risking capital, just like StockHero's marketplace bots.

And with Public.com's API, access live quotes, portfolio balances, and options chains—all in real-time, no PFOF (payment for order flow) to dilute your fills.
5. Easy Setup & Unmatched Support

Plug-and-Play: Install via pip (yfinance, talib, etc.), set your Public.com secret key, and load symbols from a simple TXT file. Runs on any machine—Python 3.12+ compatible.
Risk-Free Start: Paper trading mode simulates trades without real money. Free to build and run—no subscription fees like some bots (e.g., Trade Ideas' $118/month).
Community-Backed: Open-source inspired (GitHub-ready), with logging for debugging and 24/7 monitoring via NYSE calendar integration—trades only during market hours.

Place your public.com API keys in the location: /home/name-of-your-home-folder/.bashrc Be careful to not delete the entire .bashrc file. Just add the 2 lines to the bottom of the .bashrc text file in your home folder, then save the file. .bashrc is a hidden folder because it has the dot ( . ) in front of the name. Remember that the " # " pound character will make that line unavailable. 
Making changes here requires you to reboot your computer or logout and login to apply the changes.
