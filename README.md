Place your public.com API keys in the location: /home/name-of-your-home-folder/.bashrc Be careful to not delete the entire .bashrc file. Just add the 2 lines to the bottom of the .bashrc text file in your home folder, then save the file. .bashrc is a hidden folder because it has the dot ( . ) in front of the name. Remember that the " # " pound character will make that line unavailable. 
Making changes here requires you to reboot your computer or logout and login to apply the changes.

Add the following 2 lines to the bottom of ~/.bashrc in Linux to access Public API with the trading robot.
