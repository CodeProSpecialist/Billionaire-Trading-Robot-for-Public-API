## How Our Trading Robot Works

Our trading robot is a sophisticated Python-based application that seamlessly integrates with your brokerage account to execute trades automatically. Here’s how it brings your trading strategy to life:

1. **Real-Time Market Data**:
   - Pulls live stock quotes and historical data, ensuring you have the most up-to-date market insights.
   - Analyzes market trends with technical indicators powered by the `ta-lib` library, enabling data-driven decisions.

2. **Automated Trading Logic**:
   - Executes trades based on predefined strategies, such as momentum, trend-following, or custom rules you define.
   - Uses `pandas` and `numpy` for robust data analysis, calculating metrics like moving averages, RSI, or Bollinger Bands to identify trading opportunities.

3. **Smart Scheduling**:
   - Operates on a customizable schedule with the `schedule` library, allowing trades during specific market hours (e.g., NYSE trading hours via `pandas_market_calendars`).
   - Automatically adjusts for time zones using `pytz` to ensure timely executions worldwide.

4. **Seamless Brokerage Integration**:
   - Connects to your Public.com brokerage account via their API to fetch account details, place buy/sell orders, and manage positions.
   - Ensures secure authentication with your API secret key, keeping your credentials safe.

5. **Instant Alerts**:
   - Sends real-time SMS notifications via Twilio when trades are executed or critical events occur, keeping you informed on the go.
   - Configurable alerts let you stay in control, whether you’re at your desk or away.

6. **Database Management**:
   - Stores trade history and performance metrics in a database using `sqlalchemy`, enabling you to track and analyze your trading results over time.
   - Implements rate-limiting with the `ratelimit` library to ensure compliance with API usage restrictions.

7. **Easy Setup**:
   - Runs in the Anaconda3 base environment with a simple `install.sh` script that sets up all dependencies, including `ta-lib` version 0.6.4 from GitHub.
   - Requires minimal configuration—just set your Public.com API key and Twilio credentials as environment variables, and you’re ready to trade!

Place your public.com API keys in the location: /home/name-of-your-home-folder/.bashrc Be careful to not delete the entire .bashrc file. Just add the 2 lines to the bottom of the .bashrc text file in your home folder, then save the file. .bashrc is a hidden folder because it has the dot ( . ) in front of the name. Remember that the " # " pound character will make that line unavailable. 
Making changes here requires you to reboot your computer or logout and login to apply the changes.
